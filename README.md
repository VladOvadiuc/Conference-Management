This is a team project, which I made with another 4 classmates.We did everything from just an explanation about how a conference is 
created.
Starting from there was like starting after a discussion with a client. 
We did all of planifiaction and diagrams(UML, use cases, activity diagram,sequence diagram).
The application is a conference management webapp which supports many types of users 
(simple user, listeners, authors, speakers, program comitee members, reviewers),
every type of user should register and login to perform different actions.

Technologies used: Java, Spring, Hibernate, Jpa Repository, Postgresql for database, Angular with HTML an CSS for frontend.
Client-server communication was made using tomcat 9.0.19.

An user manual, and a more detailed description of the application can be found in Documantation.docx.
